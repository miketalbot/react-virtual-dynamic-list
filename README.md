# React Virtual Dynamic List

Yes, yet another React Virtual List... Why?

* Provides dynamic item heights
* Only measures what it draws, estimates the rest and keeps everything smooth by adjusting scroll position when sizes are 
discovered later
* Does not need to measure intermediate items when large scrolling, massively improving performance
* Does not need an accurate estimated item height
* Allows items to change size at any time
* Allows natural browser layout of the components on screen within their standard container, no individual item positioning
* Works in environments that don't constantly fire scroll events (e.g. iOS)

This component uses a O(Ln2) algorithm to work out the position of items and caches all of this for maximum performance even when scrolling huge distances.

Supports list of up to 1,000,000 pixels in height (due to browser limitations on pixel heights).  Provides events that enable any number of items.

## Installation

`npm i react-virtual-dynamic-list`

## Usage

````jsx
    <Virtual items={someCollection} renderItem={item=>(<div>{item.id}</div>)}/>
````

or

````jsx
    <Virtual items={100000} renderItem={item=>(<div>Item number {item + 1}</div>)}/>
````


### Parameters

#### (Required) `items` - array | number of items

Provides the items that will be rendered, if an array is used, the contents are passed to the renderItem function
as context, otherwise the index is passed

#### (Required) `renderItem` - function (`item`|`index`, `index`) 

A function to render the item.  The first parameter is the item or the item's index.  The second is always the index.

#### `scrollTop` - the scroll position of the component in  pixels (default to 0)

#### `scrollToItem` - scroll to show the specified index at the top of the display

#### `Wrapper` - the wrapper for items in the grid (defaults to \<div/>)

If you need your items to render properly inside a wrapper component then you can provide it here.

Your component must apply the `style` prop passed to it and render `children`

#### `Holder` - the overall holder for the grid (defaults to \<div/>)

If want to provider a component to render the whole of the virtual list you can provide it here.

Your component must apply the `style` prop passed to it, take a `ref` via `forwardRef` and apply it to the root and render `children`


#### `useAnimation` - should animation be used to help position items e.g. for iOS (defaults to true)

Animation is used in addition to scrolling.  A very minor overhead.

#### `overscan` - the number of component heights to apply as overscan (defaults to 1)

Provides a number of pages of overscan

#### `expectedHeight` - the expected height, can be very rough (defaults to 64)

Heights are worked out from averages after the first render, so something rough is fine.

#### `onInit` - function({`getPositionOf`, `getHeightOf`, `getItemFromPosition`, `itemCache`})
 
Provides access to some api functions that can be useful for modifying the list.  Often
you will cache these for later use.

#### `onSize` - function ({`averageHeight`, `height`, `item`})

Provides useful information on item sizes so you can resize the component, the most useful being
averageHeight of an item based on the items drawn.

##### `getPositionOf(item)` - returns the position of an item

##### `getHeightOf(item)` - returns the height of an item (may be estimated if not measured)

##### `getItemFromPosition(position)` - gets the item that is at a scroll position

##### `itemCache` - a Map containing the cache of all currently rendered items, you can clear this
if you like at any time. 

#### `onScroll` - function({`items`, `start`, `last`, `scrollPos`, `max`, `scroller`})

Provides an event that can modify the scroll.  You may change `items` in this function. If 
you insert things above you are probably going to have to update the scroll position
afterwards.

##### `scroller` - the element being scrolled 

you might want to fiddle with scrollTop when you add things (especially if going upwards)

##### `items` - the items being rendererd
##### `start` - the first item being rendered (off screen above)
##### `last` - the last item being rendererd (off screen below)
##### `max` - the last item that has been rendered ever (useful for loading more)
##### Also contains the parameters passed to `onInit`

````javascript 1.8
    function onScroll({max, items}) {
        if (max > items.length - 15) {
            items.push(...Array.from({length: 15}, (_, index) => ({
                id: index + items.length,
                height: Math.random() * 98 + 32 | 0,
                color: rgb(Math.random() * 112 + 143,
                    Math.random() * 112 + 143, Math.random() * 112 + 143)
            })))
        }
    }
````

### OTHER PROPERTIES

Are passed to the wrapping div that does the scrolling (this is not Wrapper, that holds the actual items).

````jsx
    <Virtual items={1000} renderItem={i=>(<div>{i}</div>)} width={80} height={200}/>
````

Sets the size of the rendered div to 80 x 200

## ScrollIndicatorHolder

This is a component you can use as a Holder for the Virtual component. It uses shadows to indicate that scrolling is
possible.

You can pass a shadow parameter throw to it via the Virtual.

````jsx
    <Virtual shadow={'0 0 32px 14px black'} items={[...items]} Holder={ScrollIndicatorHolder} renderItem={item => {
        return <Item item={item}/>
    }}/>
````

## useMeasurement

Provides the ability to measure a component using a resizeObserver - so it will redraw on resize too
which is handy. ResizeObserver is pony filled.

````javascript 1.8

    const [size, ref] = useMeasurement() 
    return <div ref={ref}>Something is {size.width} x {size.height} at {size.left}, {size.top} </div>

````
